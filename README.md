# TexasOffenses
This program does not do your job for you.  This program only brings two sources of information together
to help you do your job a little more effectively.  

When you download the TOOL.exe file (Texas Offenses OnLine), store it in a folder where you know you can locate it.
Using the file menu, choose "Update Appendix K" and the source file that is needed will be downloaded.
You can use the program to look up Texas offenses stored in the
Texas DPS Appendix K (located on the Texas DPS website) and then look up the letter of the law on the 
State of Texas Legislature website.  

To update the laws when there are legislative updates simply download the latest appendix k excel
Document by using the update feature.
