# TexasOffenses
This program does not do your job for you.  This program only brings two sources of information together
to help you do your job a little more effectively.  

When you download the TexasOffenses.exe file, store it in a folder along with the 
appendixk.xls document.  You can use the program to look up Texas offenses stored in the
Texas DPS Appendix K (located on the Texas DPS website) and then look up the letter of the law on the 
State of Texas Legislature website.  

To update the laws when there are legislative updates, download the latest appendix k excel
Document from the Texas DPS website and rename it "appendixk.xls" and be sure to save it into the 
Same directory as your TexasOffenses.exe file replacing the previously saved document.
